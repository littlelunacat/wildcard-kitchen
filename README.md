# wildcard-kitchen

Hey everyone! 👋

I love watching Wildcard Kitchen, but I noticed there’s no easy way to deal cards automatically—so I built a Wildcard Kitchen app that does it for you and your friends! 🎴🍳

🔗 Try it here: [Wildcard Kitchen Card Dealer](https://littlelunacat.github.io/wildcard-kitchen/)

It's completely free to use, and I’d love to get feedback from fellow fans. If you have suggestions for new features or improvements, let me know! Would also appreciate any help spreading the word if you find it useful. 😊

Happy cooking! 🍽🔥
